      <p align="left">Light Touch Computer Music Video (World Premiere). Music by <a href="http://www.judithshatin.com">Judith Shatin</a>; Visuals by <a href="http://goodfornow.net/home.html">Lydia Moyer</a>, based on work of chemist Cassandra Fraser, TechnoSonics XII, Rotunda Dome Room, Charlottesville, Virginia, 9/23/11, 8:00 p.m. Fraser selected materials and tools commonly used in the lab to generate mechanoresponsive surfaces. With Shatin, these were used as &quot;instruments&quot; to generate sounds that were recorded in Shatin's studio. Shatin used these to compose  sound art for this work. Moyer visited the Fraser lab and recorded Fraser demonstrating &quot;light bridge&quot; effects whereby a dye that is normally dark in the solid state lights up in the presence of a boron dye. Rebecca Babski and Alan Chien, undergraduates in the Fraser Lab conducted preliminary experiments that informed this work. Light Touch is a creative record and response to our visual and sound experiments.</p>

      <p>Tiandong Liu, Alan Chien and Professor Fraser received a travel grant from the University to participate in the trilateral program between UVA, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Peking University. On this exploratory trip we all gave research presentations, engaged in scientific exchange, met with professors and students in the Chemistry Department, and collaborated with Prof. Michael Loy and graduate student Wenhao Guo in Physics. For our Chemistry visit at HKUST we were hosted by Prof. Ben Zhong Tang and his group. We also had the opportunity to visit Hong Kong University, hosted by Prof. Vivian Yam. Both of our hosts also work in the luminescent materials field and are members of the prestigious Chinese Academy of Sciences. New ties were established with scientists at both institutions. We thank Dean Woo for the special opportunity for students to partcipate in this exploratory visit too, to represent and serve the university in this way.</p>

      <p>Professor Fraser delivered the First Annual Raymond F. Bratton lecture at Piedmont Virginia Community College on Monday October 25, talking about Fraser Lab research &quot;Light Emitting Materials for Imaging and Sensing&quot; and larger issues relating to plastics in the environment and plastic chemicals in the body. Steven Latimer, the Mathematics Examiner, covered <a href="http://www.examiner.com/mathematics-in-charlottesville/cassandra-fraser-ph-d-on-light-emitting-materials-for-imaging-and-sensing-at-pvcc">the story</a> for the Examiner.</p>
      <p>About Professor Bratton and the Bratton Lectureship: Professor Bratton jointed the PVCC faculty when it was founded in 1972, and was a dedicated professor in the Chemistry Department until his retirement. He is one of two faculty members at PVCC to win the prestigious statewide SCHEV teaching award. To honor Prof. Bratton's memory, colleagues, family and friends established this special lectureship that features &quot;a scientist who has not only accomplished important work in her or his field, but who also has the gift of making science compelling and irresistible  to an audience of both scientists and non-scientists.&quot; One of his colleagues, Professor Emeritus, Pryor Hale, notes: &quot;The late Professor Ray Bratton was a remarkable and gifted teacher and mentor for thousands of students, many of whom came to the University of Virginia, some in chemistry.   One such student has honored him by endowing the new chemistry laboratory in his memory in the just-dedicated Kluge-Moses Science Building - a wonderful tribute.  Dr. Bratton taught pre-medical students, as well as giving his time to bringing elementary students into his lab to show them that in his words &quot;Everything is chemistry.&quot;  It was his particular passion to engage students who traditionally did not feel immediately at home in a chem lab - especially women and minority students.&quot;<br />

      <p align="left">Allen T. Gwathmey was a prominent surface scientist and professor of chemistry at U.Va. from 1947-1963.  The Gwathmey Memorial Award was initiated in his honor by friends and colleagues. The Allen T. Gwathmey Memorial Award (a $5000 cash prize) is given for the best paper written on &ldquo;a fundamental problem in the physical sciences.&rdquo;  Graduate students in Chemistry, Physics or Materials Science as well as other fields of the physical sciences are encouraged to apply.  The paper should be an original and significant contribution, largely due to work of the nominee, and should provide evidence of future potential in scientific research.*</p>

    <p><strong>Fallow City Project</strong><strong></strong></p>
    <p><a href="http://www.boberska.com/">Berenika Boberska</a>, Feral Studio Architects, artist and architect in two month residence at UVA, is leading a collaborative research project at UVA entitled &quot;The Fallow City Project&quot; with students and faculty at UVA, primarily from art and architecture but also from science and engineering too. Members of the Fraser Lab, Guoqing Zhang, Alan Chien, and Prof. Fraser are grateful for the opportunity to participate in this fascinating project. More information is captured on the poster below announcing Ms. Boberska's introductory talk. An exhibit associated with this research studio will open on Friday February 26, 2010 in Ruffin Hall, UVA.</p>

      <p><strong>China Trip</strong></p>
      <p> In June 2009, Guoqing, Ruffin and Prof. Fraser traveled to China. Original plans to visit four universities were thwarted by the swine flu scare. We visited Shanghai, Hefei, Chengdu, Xi'an, Xinxiang, and Beijing. In Hefei we visited the University of Science and Technology of China, where we were generously hosted by Prof. Shiyong Liu and the prestigious Department of Polymer Science and Engineering. All three of us gave presentations to a packed house of students and faculty. Prof. Fraser and Ruffin spoke in English, and Guoqing was kindly asked to speak in Chinese. This was Ruffin's first formal scientific presentation and he impressed us all. (Our hosts thought that he was a graduate student, and included him on the schedule as such. See poster below.) We also had the good fortune to meet and spend time with Song Pan Xu (aka Spanx), an incoming graduate student and recent graduate of USTC who will join our group this fall. We appreciate his assistance from start to finish. In Xinxiang, Guoqing's home town, we had the opportunity to visit his former high school and this too made a big impression on us. This trip was a once in a lifetime experience for all of us, fostering new ties, greater appreciation and has changed our perspectives considerably. We are immensely grateful to Guoqing's  family, his parents in particular, and their vast network of friends who made our stay in China a very memorable one indeed.</p>

      <p align="left"><strong>Postdoc Position&mdash;Light Emitting Boron Biomaterials&mdash;Fraser Lab&mdash;UVA</strong></p>
      <p align="justify">A postdoc position is available now on an interdisciplinary project investigating the synthesis, fabrication, properties and applications of a new class of <a href="bdkb-chem.html">light emitting boron biomaterials</a> for imaging and sensing. Presently we are collaborating with biologists, biomedical engineers and MDs in cancer, cardiovascular and diabetes areas, and networking with companies regarding optical imaging and oxygen sensing applications. Synthetic experience (e.g. organic, inorganic, polymers) and strong analytical skills are essential. The ability to work collaboratively, and teach and learn from others is important. Interest in biomedical applications and sustainable design is a plus.</p>
