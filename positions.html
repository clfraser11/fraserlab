      <p align="left"><strong>Postdoc Position&mdash;Light Emitting Boron Biomaterials&mdash;Fraser Lab&mdash;UVA</strong></p>
      <p>The Department of Chemistry at the University of Virginia invites applications for a Postdoctoral Research Associate in materials chemistry. </p>
      <p>This is a one-year appointment; however, the appointment may be renewed for an additional two, one-year terms contingent upon available funding and satisfactory performance. </p>
      <p>The completion of a Ph.D. degree in Chemistry or a related discipline by the appointment start date is required. Candidates must be capable of performing organic, inorganic, polymer and bioconjugate synthesis, nanofabrication, and associated characterization of the compounds prepared. They must be proficient in evaluating the results of synthetic and materials fabrication studies, troubleshooting and devising new experiments, and assisting with the organization of data and the preparation of papers, reports and proposals. Group members are expected to pursue opportunities (e.g. resources, awards, fellowships, proposals, presentations) and to consider practical uses of the materials that are prepared. Postdoctoral Research Associates must work well with the research team and an extensive network of biomedical and materials collaborators, prepare samples and assist with measurements when needed for collaborative studies, and assist, mentor and help supervise graduates and undergraduates in the laboratory with synthesis, characterization procedures, analysis and interpretation of data. Teaching experience and enthusiasm for mentoring and learning are a plus. Participation in group meetings, literature review, discussion and evaluation of scientific findings, planning future research directions, and lab maintenance and improvement is required. </p>
      <p>To apply, please submit a candidate profile on-line through Jobs@UVA (https://jobs.virginia.edu) and electronically attach the following: cover letter, curriculum vitae, and the contact information for three (3) references; search on posting number 0613116. </p>
