  <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
    the 21st Century begins, several important alterations in the chemical composition 
    of Earth's atmosphere are well under way, with consequences that will be widely 
    felt over the coming decades. Many of these can be grouped under three headings: 
    depletion of stratospheric ozone, increasing trapping of terrestrial infrared 
    radiation with consequent warming of Earth's surface, and rising levels of 
    surface pollution especially in urban environments. In all three instances, 
    the major changes are occurring because of additional gases released to the 
    atmosphere through the activities of the global population.</font></p>
