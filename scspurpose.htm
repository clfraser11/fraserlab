  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These 

    are some of the questions that inspired the establishment of the Science, 

    Careers &amp; Society Forum in 1998 and have fueled its growth and expansion 

    ever since. This kind of debate honors the Jeffersonian heritage of the University 

    of Virginia and fosters its ideals--where intellectual curiosity and academic 

    excellence combined with social responsibility and a commitment to public 

    service are encouraged and lauded.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
    program was begun in the context of Chemistry 281, the third semester of the 
    honors introductory series in chemistry, with the generous support of the 
    Chemistry Department. But it quickly became apparent that the Forum was of 
    broader interest and scope than just chemistry. Since then, it has been opened 
    to the university community, and students and faculty from different departments 
    often participate. In addition to attending the Forum, students have contributed 
    to all aspects of the program, from selecting and inviting speakers to introducing 
    and hosting them. Efforts are also made to coordinate discussions with other 
    programs in the university and community. In fall 2002, for example, the SCS 
    Forum teamed with the Tremaine Forum on the Environment and the Undergraduate 
    Environmental Sciences Seminar in hosting Prof. F. Sherwood Rowland, 1995 
    Nobel Laureate in Chemistry. The Undergraduate Research Network welcomed Prof. 
    Rowland to their weekly discussion. Thanks to the efforts of Steve Macko in 
    Environmental Sciences and Karen Rheuban of the UVA Telemedicine program, 
    high school students in Craig County, Virginia also had the opportunity to 
    hear Rowland's talks via teleconferencing.</font></p>

    for future discussions, invited guests, and jointly sponsored events are welcome 

    from individuals and student, faculty and community programs.</font></p>
