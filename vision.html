      <p align="justify">The Fraser  group and our extensive collaborative network conduct interdisciplinary  research exploring the interactions between synthetic materials and their  surroundings. In the laboratory we design and synthesize new materials with  distinctive properties. We tailor these systems to address fundamental  questions in science and adapt them for specific practical applications.  Consideration of environmental and other societal dimensions of the materials  fabrication process are also important to us, both intellectually and in the  research enterprise in our laboratory. We adopt a collaborative,  interdisciplinary approach, encourage cooperative learning and initiative, and  tailor educational and research programs to suit the interests and goals of  group members. </p>
      <p align="justify">The concept of biomaterials  provides a framework for understanding our program and its long-term goals and  directions. </p>
      <p align="justify">Traditionally, this term  refers to materials used in medicine, namely drug delivery systems, tissue  engineering matrices, imaging agents, and other devices that are interfaced  with the body. Biomedical materials are of great interest to us, and our group  is engaged in a number of priority projects in these areas. With biomedical  collaborators, we are investigating luminescent biomaterials for imaging and  oxygen sensing and other stimuli responsive systems in tumor, cardiovascular, and diabetes islet cell transfer models.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify">Biomaterials also refers to  bio-inspired design, the study and application of design principles of natural  materials. Because nature is so far ahead of us when it comes to sophisticated  multifunctional materials, biological systems provide an abundance of ideas for  features to incorporate into responsive synthetic materials. Of particular  interest are: </p>
      <div align="justify">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>modular approaches to macromolecular synthesis</li>
          <li>the relationship between the linear sequence of basic       subunits, the molecular architecture, conformation, and hierarchical       assembly structures</li>
          <li>functional materials that sense, adapt and respond to       their environments</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p align="justify">In fact, our polymeric  metal complex platform was inspired by the diverse structures and functions of  metalloproteins.&nbsp; In our fundamental  materials research, we strive for a better understanding of synthetic  principles, materials properties, and processing parameters of these  macromolecular metal systems. Although we are often inspired by nature, our  program is not restricted to biomimicry. Much of what we do is simply driven by  curiosity, the thrill of discovery, the desire to develop new approaches to  functional materials and to better understand their fundamental properties.  With collaborative teams of engineers, biologists, MDs and companies, we  envision innovative uses for our materials in biomedicine, nanotechnology,  sustainable design, and other contexts.</p>
      <p align="justify">Finally, if we are to make  materials that interface with biological systems in more intelligent ways, we  must also develop a thorough understanding of the interactions that occur at  the biological/synthetic interface. As molecular and nano-scientists, we are  captivated by events that occur on a very small scale. Recognition, attachment,  imaging, sensing and adaptation are recurring themes in our research. As  scholars who think more broadly, we are also interested in design at other  length scales. And as citizens, we are concerned about the implications of  materials fabrication for the health and well being of humanity and the  environment, on both local and global scales. While we are eager to develop  innovative materials and to better understand their properties and potential  applications, we also strive to adopt sustainable practices to accomplish  these goals.</p>
